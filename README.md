This is my very first attempt at making a game with Pygame while also wanting to learn Python.

Montclair is a click-only, text-based psychological-horror game. You, the player, are an IT System Administrator starting a new job at the Montclair Data Center. You're scheduled for the evening shift, which is perfect for you as it makes it easier to focus on your work without any unnecessary distractions.

However, following tradition with the genre, that never happens and it always means it's going to lead to something "not good". The "not good" is that, over time, you start noticing things. Little things, but things nonetheless. Things that don't make sense within a data center, like phone calls from a bizarre number, system reports displaying gibberish, or all the server racks in a room suddenly disappearing.
